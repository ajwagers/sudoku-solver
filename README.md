# sudoku-solver
A sudoku-solver using simulated annealing.  

Currently this is set up as a Jupyter notebook for troubleshooting purposes.  I have been able to come close to solving the puzzle but I haven't been able to finish a solution.  I am not sure at this point if it is my algorithm or if I haven't run enough iterations.  This is still a work-in-progress.

Currently, the solver seems to get stuck in local minimas.  I am working to tweak the annealing and or combine it with another method to make it faster and more robust.
